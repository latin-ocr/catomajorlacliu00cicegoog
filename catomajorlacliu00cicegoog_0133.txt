go ιο ruin, and when that process bcs commenced, there is nc com·
pensaticn on this side of death. ,

The third objecticn (lato declares to be cn advanmge If old age, he
says, mitigatos the fever of the blood, it enables the mind to see that
the attractione of virtue are superior ιο those of senm. At the same
time, so far from cutting off all kinds of pleasure, it selects those that
are not barmful-such aethere connected with socisl intercourse and
mrnl soenes-and conjcins them with that love of learning and wisdom
which is too often the exclusive possession cf old ege On the whole,
perhaps, it may bs said that the young hare more impulsos ιο good,
more temptatione ιο evil, than the old. It dependson tha habits of
the old whether they are better cr worse than they were in early life.

'fo the fourth objection it is replied, (ll that deathis harmiess if it
lead ιο annihilation, and desirable if it lead ιο a higher lifs; (2) that
death is the murel goal of old age. and therefore not to be dreaded3
(8) that the old man is better off than the young man, ιοιειιεο ιο has
gained what the other can only hope tc gain; (4) that that which is so
highly endowed ae the human mind is probably immonni, (5) that
the mind, being in a state of perpetual movement in consequence of its
own spontaneous οοιινίιγ, rriust, as it cannot desert iteelf, go on oom-
norruneuertere rueretrueret
subject ιι death; (7) that the rapidity with which children acquire
knowledge, isaproof that they are but remcmbering what was first
communicated ιο them in a previous state of existence, and that there·
fore what we call death may well be nothing more than a change into
another life ; (8) that as the soul is not an attribute of the body, but
uses it ae its instrument, the destruction of the body is no proof of the
destnrction of the soul ; (9) that the honour aud respect pald to the
dead prove that they are still exemising an influeres on the living;
(10) that tbs mindie likely to be more, not less, full of life, when
freed from the impure companionship of the body; (11) thul the
powers of the miud are sometimes strengthened and exalted in sleep,
and will therefore be still greater when death has snapped altogether
the chains that tie it down tc the body; (12) that the desire of fame,
aud the willingness ιο work for the benefit cf Eosterity, prore an innata
consciousness of immertality; (18) that ast o good man, who must
necessarily see further into the constitution of things than the bad
manis always more willing to diethan the bad man, he must necessarily
see immortality before him, audrsjoice in the prospect ofmingling aud
claiming kindred with the spirits of his own departed friends, and of
, the good and great of whom he has so often heard and read with
admiration and love.

These arguments may be taken in their order :-

(1.) 'l'he first argument is a dilemma, the conclusiveneas of which ie
vitiated by asking the question, What if death lead to a lower instead
of ιο s higher lifel The feor cf future punishment held so strongly,
but under such grotesque forms ιγ the vulgar, and laughed at by
philosophers (see Cicero'e Tusc. Disp. i. 5, 6). hae been revived and con·

firmed ιγ the greater cousciousness of sin introduced by Christianity.

(tl Τ ie would convince no one; for the position that whateveris
natural is not to be dreaded, would be small comfort to any one sull'er

ing from physical pain or sorrow for the dead.
