ιο the sentimenta entertained about him by Hortensius end cesar
(see chaps. tl and 72).

Perhaps Cicero wished not only ιο set himself right in the opinion
of Brutus and others, but eleo to induce Brutus, for whom he uu·
doubtedly had considerable regerd, to desert the ranke of the effeto
school tc which he had a lsaning, and give fair play to his talents ογ

edopting that vigorous aud effective style cf oratory which he was et i

present inclined to blame Cicero for following. At env rate thie will

this trectise· and in the Orator.

With respect to the objection brought forwerd by Atticus, that
Cicero had injured the artistic effect of his treatise bytho number of
second end third-rate persons thet he had crowded into it, there is no
doubt that itis well founded. Hsd he confinsd himself to those who
were really distinguished, and given an accurate and life-like pertrait
of each of them, he would have produced a more taking work. But hs
was probably prompted ογ his patriotic feelings to show that Rome aa
well as Grecos could show a long roll cf illustrious names, and point
to a long series of wcrhs well worthy to be read As it is, however,
‚ we have a very complete pisce of literery history, bearing inter-nal
procis of great labour and impartiality, and interspersed with general
rules of art, criticisms on individuale, end modes of speaking, and dis-
quisitions on subsidisry mettere, of very considerable interest.

1. Eulogium on Hortensius, who had recently died.

Ε Cilicia decedent. 'l'his was in ths yser ac. tc. when Cicero's pro·
consulshi of cilicie was over, end hewse returning thence towards
Rome-d Hortensius was born rac. 114, and was therefore eight years
older than Cicero; hewse retained ογ Verres to defend him against
Cicero, ac. 70, was consul rac. 69, end died sc. 50. Thcugh Cicero
was jealous of him through life, it does not follow that he wus not
siucerely shocked et the news of his death. See Ep. ad Att. vi. 6.
‘⁴ De Hortensio te certo scic dolere: equidem excrucior.”-eooptotum.
Cicero had been chossn by the influence of Hortensius end Pompey

11. Regret that, in the present state of public etlaire, there is no
scope for the free exercise of oratory. 'Phe only consolation left ie to
think over the illustrious oratore of past times, es Cicero was enabled
to do in a late conversation with Atticus and Brutus.
