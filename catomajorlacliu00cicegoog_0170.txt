saurus. ' 157

The mention of Calvus enables Cicero to make a strong proteat
against ιιο folly of th0 practice, introduced by Calvus, of aiming at a
lifeless concinuity and suphuistic purism of style, undar the noticn of
its being specially Attio and refined, whereas it missod th0 grand
characteristic of true Attio oratory-the approbation of ιιο publio.

Cicero now proposes to return to Hortensius himself, when Atticus
reproaches him, with all the freedom of an old friend, for having

¹ overcrowded his canvas with ιοο many figures, and having made too ,

free a use of irony in professing such extravagant admiration for the
productione of many of the old oratore. Cicero declaras himself
to be guiltlese on both charges, and professes his willingness to enter
on his justificaticn at a litter time end in another place. He then
depicta Hortensius's career and his own st length, together with the
relations in which they stood ιο cachethes. He describes the course
of study that he pursued, in order to overcome his natural defects, and
strengthen his constitution, and heighten his oratorical powers ιο ιιο
utmost. He explains that Hortensius was less valued as an oratoria
his old age than in his youth, partly ιοοοοοο ιο really fell off from not

“ taking as much paine as he used to take, aud partly because the halatis
redundancy and efflorescsnoe of the style that he affected did not suit
the dignity of age as well as it fell in with the exuberance of youth.
Hs then prenounces Hortensius happy in having died just before the
extinction of free political discussion; lements over the troubles ,
impending over the commonwealth, and regrets that the rising genius
of Brutus is not likely ιο have any opportunity of opening itsslf out,
and rising inte public view, Here the work closes abruptly; the con·
cludiug centenam being lost through the mutilation cf the manuscript
from which all the existing copies ars derived.

One of the objecta for which Cicero wrote the Brutus was of course
to move nearer towards the completicn of the oycle of his works on
oratory, by giving the historical view of the subject. But any one who
will take the pains to examine the nature of ιιο digressione in this
work, bearing in mind the nature of the attacks made upon Cicero's
style cf eloquence, both in his own time and after his death, will easily
perceive that heis endeavouring throughout the dialogus to show the
falsity of the charges brought against him, and ιο fix his own rightful
position ae a follower of the school of Demosthenes.

Hence,if Cicero was aware that Brutus had called him ‘⁴ fractum atque
elumbem” t'l'acit Or. xviii), and that Calvu prenounced him to be
“solutum et enervem,¹' and that the school of which Calvus was the
favourite declared hirn ιο have followed the redundancy and tamid
repetition of the Astatia oratore rather than the closely packed conciss-
ness of those of Attica, we can understand why Cicero should, on the
one hand, particularly have addressed himself ιο Brutus, while taking
great pains to point out the error into which Calvus had fallen in
thinking that a bloodless and lifeless formality could possibly ιο
Demosthenic; and, on the other hand, why he pointed out that Hor·
tensius and not he was the imitator of ths Asiatics, while he, on the
{itta lfnzt‘titttt?’tllftzuttttlltt tlt iffi*
Isocrates, with the nervs and pith and recinens of the older Ro:
writers and speakers. And ιο fortify himself in the position hs
thas assumed, he makes Brutus aad Atticas give atter-anes respect
