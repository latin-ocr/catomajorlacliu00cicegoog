very cleverly to intrigue l'or Caesar against Pompey, by putting on an

Crassus, son of the triumvir Crassus (see notes on cb. lxv.), was one of
Caesar’s legates in Gaul, and remainad with him there till his father's
second consulship ao. 55. The next¹ year he accompanied his father ιο
Syria, and died fighting bravely on the field of Carrhae, though an
opportunity of escape presented itsell. Why CIcero gives us such a
harsh picture of him it is difficolt to understand, as he tried ιο prevent
Caesar's banishment‚ showed a sincere attachment to him throughout
his life, and the very last time he was in Rome endeavoured to reconcile
him and barachos-imperatori, ie„ Cacsar.-aetatem certam, because

LXXXII. 'Phe oratory and oratorical position oi Calvus. What it is
to be an Attio orator.

C. Lanius Macer Calvus. son of the Licinius Macer mentioned in eh.

that there is no doubt oi its justice. Ηο was also a poet os she school
ol Catullus, with whom hs was intimate; and his love poema and sati·
rieal epigrams were highly admired, as may be seen from H orace's well-

Imown line (I Sat. x. 19.)
“Nil prester Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum.”

For the reason why Cicero dwells so long on the subject of his oratory
see Introduction.-sonyuimm deperdebat. See Tacit. Or. xviii, “legistis
utique et Calvi et Bruti ad Ciceronem missas epistolas, ex quibus facile
est deprehendere Calvum andem Ciceroni visum exsanguem et attri-
