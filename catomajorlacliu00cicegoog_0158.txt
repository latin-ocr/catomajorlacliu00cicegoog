VIII. Whether friendship springs from the prospect of advantage;
nr from a natural impulse-For the doctrine'containad in this and
the next chapter, compare Aristotle’e Ethics, viii. 3.

Snpcrbm, the last king of Rome, reigned from sc. 532 to nc. ⁵07, and
was driven out in consequence of the tyrannical conduct of himself and
his sons-Spurius Ocaaiue Viscelliruae, consul for the tin-t time s. o. 502,
and for the third time 13. o. 486, the renewerof the league with the
Latius and Hernicans, fell a victim to patrician hate for proposing and
carrying the first agrarian lew; and being uccused of aiming at the
regal power was scourged and beheadsd.—Haunihale . . . credelitatem.
So Livy (xxi. 4), loys to his charge tnhwnaonu oudelitoe, perfidia plas-

, quom Punica. But the charge is probably altogether false. Polybius

expressly denies it, and Livy mentions several circumstances which

¹ tend to disprove it See Livy xxi. 21, 22; xxv. 17 ; xxvii. 28.

IX. The trus origin of friendship is to be found in the natural desire
of loving in others that which is truly worthy of love, Ι

Usu, “in intimacy.''-aeacpuatar,i. e, quisquc, which appears in the
dependent clause. This, indeed, is fis usual position, as may be seen
in the next sentence. so Gern. quotes Cic. Offic. Ι. 20, 65, “ Facillime
autem ad res injustas impellitur, ut quisque est altissimo animo, gloriae
cupiditate.”-ut quisquc, ‘¹ aa each one.’'-sed nawa, rte. It would seem
more natural to have aed qaia nctrwo, dc, unless we place the clause
in the parenthesis with neque enim beneficium scurrarum—Ab bae,
“ froin this view.'’-ca'9ru'ficotrbne probitatis, ‘⁸ indicatione of goodness.'’
-parea ic umore, “ equal in strength of affection.”-aequober‚ equal in
position with respect to each other.”-toec, though referring to the
previous clause, is attracted aa usual to agree with racematio, the

substantive that follows itt-cultio, i. e, dicon

XI. As to the question how faraman should obligo a friend, it is
determined that a man ought neither to ask a friend nor himself
consent, if asked, to do anything that is dishoncurable.

name from the capture of the Volscian city Corioli, and being afterwards
banished hythe plebs, nc. ltu, offered his services to the Volsciar
