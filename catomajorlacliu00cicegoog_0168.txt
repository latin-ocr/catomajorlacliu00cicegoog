Tau Bartae, or Dialogus on Fumone Oratore, was written in ths
early part of the year aa. 46, while the issue of the campaign in Africa
between Caesar and the temnant of the Pompeian party was still being

expected by Cicero with considerable auxiety, though with little hope
that the republic would be able to resume its independence, und be
himself, or his friends find a career of political distinction once more'

'l'he Brutus was suggested, as Cicero informs us, by hia friend
Atticus’s chronological re‘samd of the history cf Rome. With this as
his guida, he determined to give a chronological sketch of tha progress
of Roman oratory from the earliest period for which materials might
bs within resch, to his own time. 'Phe trsatise that resulted from this
determination assumed the form of a dialogus between himself, his old
and tried friend Atticus, aud his younger and less intimate friend
Brutus, afterwards one of the chief conspirator· against Caeear. 'l'he
maeting is supposed to take place in Cicero's garden at Rome. There
he is musing on the evil of the times, and the death of the great orator
Hortensius, when he is called upon by Atticus and Brutus, who urge
him, aa a meahs of escape from thoughts about ths present, to fulfil an
old promise he had made, to give them a shetoh of the orators of past
times. With this request Cicero promises tc comply; and, after
promising that in Grecos, as in Rome, eloquente sprung up long after
tha rest cf the fine arta, proceeds to give a rapid view of Gracina
orator-y from tha time oi Pisistratus to the period when it was trane·
planted into Asia, and there rapidly degenerated into wordiness and
bombast Then, turning to his own countrymsn, and running over
the names of some of those wh0, in earlier times, must, from their
position and echievements, have necessarily possessed the power of
influescing others by their eloquente, he states that Ceto the Censor
is the first man whose writings are still extant in sufficient quantity to
enable men to judge fairly of his merita, and that he is indeed worthy
of all praise and study, though deficient in some of the graces of style
which had not then been introduced into prose composition. 'l'hen

older, and Q. Metellus, 0. Laelius, and the younger Africanus, s
beyond all the rest, Ser. Galba, among the younger of Cato's cor
poraries, are quoted as distinguished speakers. 'l'he mention of
