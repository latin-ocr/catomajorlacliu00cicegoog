caro nacon. 121

(3). Τιιιι is also apocr argument. He who has already enjoyed

what another hopes to enjoy, is by no means sure to think himself
better off (he may think himself worse off) for what he has bad, but
can have no longer. Past enjoyment is a poor compensation for
present trouble.
Ἴ (l). This has always been felt to be a strong argument, especially if
it be connected (as, however. it is not here) with the nature of God,
³ and the improbability that a Being of infinite benevolence should
¹ pmtpoy that which he hae created “ so noble in reason, so infinite in
acu ties.”

(ι). This proves nothing. It might bo similarly argued that the
beart, because it expande and contracte spontaneouely, can never stop
beatin .

(6.)g'1'his is an excellent argument It may be scen expanded and
made the most of in auclore Analogy, Part l., Chapter 1.

(7.) rtis argument is horrowed from Plato (see the rhedo, ch.
xlviii.) ; but as it rests on an assumption far more doubtful than that
which it is intended to support, it proves nothing. The noticns that
the mind ola child forme with such marvellous rapidity are just those
which are necessarily evolved from the intellectuel constitution that
(lod has given him, when onae it-is brought into contact with the
motiva power of experience.

(8,) This also is sn argument powerfully insisted on by Butler ιιι
the first chapter of his Analogy. Add to this, however, the fact οι
which chamistry informs us, that no particle of any one body, no
single atom of the material universe, of any kind whatever, has yet
perished3 and all analogy is shown to be still more plainly in favour of
the continuance, not of the dissolutior, of the immaterial part of man.

(9.) Itis very natural to suppose that what still affecte us existe,
and that, if we can by our words and deeds affect posterity, we must
stand in a living relation ιο ιι. But logically the argument isweak.
What is natural cannot be proved to be therefore true.

(10.) This is sn untenable argument. Matter is not in itself either
good or evil, and therefore connection with it does not involve a lower·
form of life than freedom from it. The seat of good and evil is in the
will, which puts the matter connected with it ιο good οι· evil uses,
according to the n «turc of its selideterminatioa.

(11.) This argument contradicts plain facts. 'Phe mind is not
strengthened and exalted in sleep, because the will is then weakened.

(12.) See the remarks on (9).

(13.) The good are readier ιο die than the bad, not because they
see that there is a future more clearly, but because their consciences
tell them that itis not terrible for them to die. Both the good and Ι
the bad have the instinct ol immortality within them, though to one
class it is sn object of hope, to the other cf fear. But perhaps
Dr. Brown is right in saying that the general belief in the immortality
of tha soul is no necessary proof of its reality. It is at least con·
ceivable that (1οά may have merely given the good the hope cf a future
life to cheer and comfort them, and to the bad the fear of a future life
to tcrrify and restrain them. Men would gain by such abelief, even if
ιι were unlounded.

On the whole, it may be said tlrat the reasons given by Cicero herr
and elsewhere (see the Somnium Scipionis end the Tusculan Disput
