need 01 mutual toleration‚ aad forbearance, aad trust One offence,
however, is fatal to friendship; and that is, impatience at advice, when
given in akindly and delicate manner. So, cf course, flattery and a
love of flattory are incompatible with friendship.

Lastly, Laelius returns 10 110 consideration 01 110 numanam? or
11111 wisa, and reassertsthat Virtue alone can gain or preserve it ;
declares that 10 100 chosen all his friends on this principle; and that, ’
with 110 0010 exception of virtue 110011, nothing is to be preferred to it,
{either for the delight it gives, or for the nobility of character that it
uetera.

lt will be evident from this analysis of the contents of this dialogus
on friendsbip, that it is by no means so simple or so regular aa that on
old age. The subject itself is more difficult, and perhaps more depen-
dent on principles which, from Cicero's position, were less known to
him than to us. For instance, perhaps the least satisfactory part 01 110
dialogus is that in which the practioal rules enunciated for the benefit
01 110 wise are separated from those intended for 110 not wise. The
treatire would have been much simplified, aad some repetition would
have been avoided, if the two sets of rules had been amalgamated, aa
there ie no such broad line of demarcation between men and man 00 to
make what is said to one totally inapplicable to another. Cicero was pro·
bably in some measure under the influenee 01 the then common opinion
that the good and the bad are radically distinct one from the other;
and that, aa virtue is not to be learnt, there 10 0 great gulf fixed
between them, which neither oen pass over; whereas the trae view
is that all men have both good and evil within them, and that they
¹ can all be taught 10 foster the good and hold down and destroy the
evil in them} and hence, having the same naturas, and being open to
the same faults, can profit by thesemo sales

Again we, before whose eyes the Pattern Friend has been evidently

set 10111, and who know that the proper eim of life is to live for God’s
glory, ought to be able to see more clearly than it was given to Cicero
to see, that we ought to choose men as our friends according 00 they
bear the marks of likeness to Him who isset before us as our model;
that among such we should cleave most to those who can best help us

in doing the work which God has given ns to do, and that oar duty 10

11000 whom we have 00 chosen is in like manner to aid them in doing

110 work 001 before them, that 00 we and they may help each other to

lb: lconformed to 1101 image which it ia the will 01 God that we should
0 ike.

From these consideratione 110 whole theory and practice 01 friendslrip
may be deduced. 11 Cicero is at fault once or twice in the course of
his remarks on the subject, the wonder is that with his light he saw so
much. There are few writings 0111001010110001111011011011001110,
