that which deserves ιο be loved, and that it ie for this reason-because
the tendency to friendship is a part of the original constitution of our
being, which is, of course, not susceptible of change-that true aud
perfect friendship is itself eternal.

He then, after a little more pressing, goes on ιο treet t’teaeutcattr

that which he has considered hitherto canceraremur. He first remarks ·

how difficult it ie ιο raise common every-day acquaintance to the height
of that true and perfect friendsbip which he has been praising, in con·
sequence of the promptiugs of ambition in noble, and of lower feeliugs
in iguoble, naturas. This leads him to consider how far we should go
iu doing what our friends ask us to do; and he decides that uve should ¹
do for them, and expect from them, only what is houourable, but that
within the area marked out by that limitation we should do all we can
for them, without waiting tc be asked, freely giving advice, or throwiug
in reprocf, when necessary, knowing well that the joys arising from
friendship far outweigh any trouble it may entail, and keeping iu sight
that we become more truly human, and therefore more divine, as our
affectione enlarge and become more actim. Hence it may be seen that,
though friendship does not spring from the prospect of advantage, yet
advantage results from friendship, as all true friends are impelled to .
do good to each etheria order to show their love.

With respect ιο the tmtrs of friendship, Laelius says, there are three
prevalent opinions: (1) that we must feel towards our friends es
towards oursclves; (2) that our regard for them must correspond to
their regard for us; (3) that we must set the same value on them aa ,
they do on themselves. 'l'he first is wrong, because there are many
occasions on which we may gracefnlly do for others what we could not
venture to do for ourselves3 the second is wrong, because it would be
intolerable ιο weigh friendships in the scales, and keep a debtor and
creditor account respect-ing it ; and the third is equally at fault, because
if our friends undervalne themselves, as the good often do, or if they
despair ol success iu life, we are bound not ιο do so, but to value them
might, end encourage them to hope for better things. Iu fact there
should be aperfect commuuity in all respecta, in plan and in will.

Hence the necessity of care in the duotore of friends. The firm and
stable and consistent alone should be chosen; aad such characters are
ιο be found only among the good. It follows that old friends are
better than new oues, as their good qualities must be known, and
have been long tried, and the power of habitin cementing affection is
atron .

Agitnchere should be an acuatrrr between friends, the superior
putting himself on an equality with the inferior, aud helpiug him to
riae as far aa his capacity will let him; aud the inferior not grieviug at
the advancement of the superior.

Laelius now descende from the intimacies of the wisa ιο cantatur
ratuunsmrs. Such connectione, he says, must occasionally be dis·
solved; but they should be so dissolved that some of the former· tender-
ness of feeling be preserved, and no bitterness or open eumity super
vene. But as this isa difficolt matter, we should take the greatest
care with whom we get acquaffited, and first try to be good ourselves,
and then seek our associatos among the good. And friendship is worth
all thistronble; for without it life would be intolerable. Agaiu, as
differendas must ariae in the wear aud tear of life, there is coustant
