saurus. ¹173, Ι

common in Greek-respondere: “to give counsel’a opinion,’' as we
should now cal-l it.

XLII. The same subject Brutus regrets that the state can no
longer avail itself of SulpicIus's advice and Cicero’s eloquence,but1s
forbidden b'y AttIcus to indulge in political reflectione.

L, Lucilios Balbus was one of the pupils of Q. Mucius Scaevola, and a
man of much legal knowledge-0. Aquiltua cottas was also one of the
pupils of Scaevola, and was one of the great remediers of the desecte of
the Romen law-Sami. This was Iao. 47, when Brutus went to meet
Caesar at N lcaea, after having been pardoned by him—jas nostrum pou-
tr'fict'um. Brutus was one of the college of pontifis—wora modo = wora
modo aaa, the negative in rae-quidam being referred to both clauses, us
is often the case when both clauses have the same predicate, and the
predIcate stands in the latter.

XLIII. Cicero· reverte to tha manner and career of Crassus, and
states that in him first Roman oratory arrived at its maturity, and little
roem was left for subsequent improvement, except at the hands of one
who should combine in LImself a mastery over legal, philosophical, and
historical knowledge.

ἐπ attercando, “in the inter-change of brief replies and arguments''
with the ceunsel for the opposite side-C. Garamam. See notes on
ch. xxxviii-latmo, the Vestal Virgin, a relation of Crassus’s as may
be seen from the nume, was defended by him (uo. 114) from the
charge of incest brought against her and some other· Vestal Virgins;
but the well-known severity of the accuser, L. Cassius (see ch. xxv),
nullified all Crassus's efforts-adolescens. It was in no. 118, and
therefore four years before his defence of Licinia, that Crassus advo-
ested the establishnrent of a colony at Narbonne for the benedt of the
poor, though against the inter-ests, as it was thought at the time, of
the senate-iu aum opem, “ oo that law.''—aena'ar, “ maturer in style.”
-ottanuaoa This was rao. 107.— Q. Gracina, though only, like Horace's
father, a money-collector for auctionem, was well known in Rome for
his witty sayings (see Smith's Biog. Dict.) He figured for the same
reason in the Satires of Lucilius-leyen Seruilium, i. e, the law of Q.
Servilius Caepio. See notes on ch. xxxv. lt may be observed, however,
that there was another lex &aazia of exactly an opposite tendency
which was brought forward by Ο. Servilius Glaucia two years after-
wards. This letter law abroguted Caepio’s law, and reinstated the
Sempronian law of 0. Gracchus—Hie covzsula'boa, i‚e., 0. Atilius Ser·
ranus aud Q. Servilius Caepio, nc. lod-aiat qui. . . contractior. Here
Cicero evidently hints at himself, and intimatas what, in his opinion,
his superiority over Crassus consiste in.

XLIV. Cicero evades the question as to whether Orassus's superIor
has yet arrived, and proceeds with Crassus’s career.

aut, “ or rather,” introduces a correction of erat, and not a different
question, which would require ‹zu-Pro Q. Ooepione. See notes on
ch. xxxa-anstites is the LatIn translation of περίοδος, ae mambra is
of adhe The latter term is explained in Ad Her. iv. 19, 26, “Mem-
brum orationis appellatur res breviter absoluta sine totius sententiae
demonstratione, quae denuo allo membro excipitur.” lle then gives as
