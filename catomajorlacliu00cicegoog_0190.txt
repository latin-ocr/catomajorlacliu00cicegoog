This lawsuit in which scevola, the pontifex, was engaged for Coponius
the next-oflrin, and Crassus for M'.·Ourius, was instituted by Coponius
on these grounds: A man who supposed his wile to be about to give
birth to a son, on his death-bed made a will, leaving his property to
this son that he supposed would soon bs born 3 at the same time laying ¹
down that, ifthe son should die before he came of age to make a will ¹
ofhis own, the property should go to Μ’. Curius. As the wife gave
birth to no son, Μ’, Curius entered on possession asa matter of course;
and Μ. Coponius, who was uentos-kin, brought an astion to turn him
out, because as he maintained, Curius had no right to the property,
aocordingto the terme of the will, until a son had been born, and
died ; and as that event had not taken, and now could not take, place,
the property ⁰h¹3hl¹²⁰ revert to him as next-of·kin.-captiosum, “ dan·

0. Aurelius Cotta was born Be. 124. He sided with M. Livius

according to the lec Varia de Mcjsstate, for trying to gain the franchise

was born in the same year as Cotta, and, like him, was a friend ol M.
Livius Drusus; but though when Drusus went over to the popular
side, Sulpicius went with him, there can be no doubt that whatever
Drusus's motivas were, Sulpicius was bought, to help to obtain the

when Sulla entered the city, and Sulpicius was discovered, he wss at
