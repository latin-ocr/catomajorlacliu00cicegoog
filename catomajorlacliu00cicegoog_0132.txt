NOTES ΟΝ THE ΟΑΤΟ MAJOR.

-4—

Tun Cato Major was written in the year rao. 44, a time when Cicero,
in order ιο abstract his attention from public affairs, and from hia grief
at the loss of his dearly loved daughter, Tullia, was devoting himself
almost incessantly to study, and was pouring forth from his well-stored
mind treatise after treatise with amazing rapidity. If, however, we
compare the Cato Major with the works which we know to have been
written immediately before it, we shall findit marked by an accession

of cheerfulness, and arenewed desire for political action, which can Ι

best be accounted for by the supposition that it was written soon alter
the death of Julius Caesar, when a man ol Oicaro's sanguine tem·
peramant might hope for the regeneration of his country, aud a chance
ol being able ιο devote himself to its service. Hence probably it was

’ that he conceived the plan ol holding up to his countrymen as worthy

of all imitation the picture of a good and wise and practical man

devoting himself energetically and joyfully ιο the republic from his

earliest days to the extreme vergo of old age. 'Phe person whom he
thus depicta as his model Roman was Cato the Censor, a man of gratu
powers, both ol body and mind, and of undoubted zeal for the common
good, but at the same time rude, hareb, bitter, and revengelul. Cicero,
however, in pursuance of his design, tonse down or omits these dis·
agreeable qualities, clothes him with his ownlearning and liberal
spiu't; and ao represents a man whom it would be an honour indeed ιο
be like in almost all respects.

'ibe treatise is thrown into the form οι· a dialogue, held in the year
ac. 150, between Cato, then in his eighty-fourth year, and hie two sons·
inlaw, Scipio and Laelius. They are supposed to find him, in spite of
bie age, so vigorous in mind and body, that they are induced to ask
him how it is that he bears the burden of years so lightly. Cato at
once denies that old age is necessarily a burden. He then states that
the argumente generally brought forward to prove that it is eo are,
(1) that it shuts men out from public life; (2) that it wealrens the
bodily strength; (3) that it cute off almost every source of pleaaure;
and, (4) that it leads on ιο death.

The first objection is met by particular instances of eminent men
who retained their vigour ιο the laet. Ιι is evident however, that a
few particular instances cannot invalidatea general rule resting on a
far more eopious induction.

'Phe second objection is more fairly traversed by the statement that
youthful vigour may be more than compensated by the experience oi
riper years, and that a temperate youth will produce a hale and green
old age. There is atime, however, when tbe bodily organisation will
