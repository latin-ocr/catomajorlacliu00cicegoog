XVII. That no limite should be set ιο οιιι· ιιίοιιιιιιιὶρ, but that, lf
only we have ohosun our friends rightly, there should be aper-fect cout-
munity of all things established between us and them. Hence the

loss of civil rlghts. The ιιιιιτιιιια capitit deminutio involved the loss of
libertae, avitae and fartilia, and the phrase ceput apirur· was used net
only when life, but also when these were in jeopardy. So that, as
Ernesti says, “quoties formula hujusmodi apud Latinos occurrit,
semper de quibus hominibus, de quibusque causis sermo sit videndum,
atquibus ex legibue causa agatur, iisque quar poenae propo-ita fuerint.
Nam ita demum eapitis quae sit vis intelligi poterit.’'-modo razdom·
modo rra-eet anim qautenus, &a Gernhard quotes the saying of Peri·
olas: Δεῒμε συμπράττειν τοῖς φίλοις, atah μέχρι teda-foma, “a good
reputatiou.”-btaaditiieet maculando, “by complaisance and unwilling·
nese to contradiet''—eajua omnia sarno crat de, “who was always talk·
ing about ” &o.—auata'rvere impetam, ‘¹ ιο cheelr the outgoings of his‚'’
ara-quo 'rs here used for at or ιιι eo, without being followed hy a eom·
parative. So Sall. Jug. 33.-“neque quo pericula aliie faceremue.”-

{ verned by consecuti aaut, not by the supine charniacum, which has for
³ its object some such phrase as ‘⁶ turpem consequenda potentie) ratio-
, nem,” or “neglectam amicitiam,’' from the previous sentence. Gein-
’ hard quotes Ota Verr. iii. 57,131. ‘⁸ Quod magnitudo lucri obscuraret

periculi magnitudinem.'’ obsera-atam, being the active supine after the
verb of motion ιἰἰ, of course governs an accusative. See Key's Gram·
mar§1262.

XVIII. rue foundation-stone of friendship is sincerity.

Utroque ia ra, i. e.‚ “ in bis own prosperity and his friaud'sadversity.''
-oommarrem, “ affable.”-—ecaeeatientem, “with a sympathy of testes!-
paem eoadem, “ whom also.’'-fietum . . . amatura. Simulare, “to
make like ” (from simitu), differs from fingere, ‘¹ ιο invent,” or ‘⁸ feign”
in more strongly expressing the intention ιο deceive—fronte occultare.

So the Romans, looking on the face as an index to the mind, used the ,

phrases frontem contrahere, explicare, sobora—Accedat is governed by

’ ιιι understood after eportet-tatae aaa quidem, “has indeeu’· For
¹ this emphasising use of illc οιιιάοιιι see iu the next chapter, “ N evitatas

autem . . . non sunt tllae quidem repudiandae.”-aonaitoa, “kindliness,”
le a moral virtue, facilitas, ‘⁴ sociability,'' a weial one.

new wine or new horses are ιο be preferred ιο old wine aud trIed
horsea. The importunae, in cases of friendsbip, of the superior'e belng

qaoe vamtatem seruat, “which can stand keepIng.”-Noeitotca, ‘⁴ what

⁴* noveltiee '’ for ‘⁶ new things.'’-aora fallacibus, “that do not oheat the
farmer’s hopee.” Sommerbodt quotes Hor. Od. III. i. 30, “ fundusqn
