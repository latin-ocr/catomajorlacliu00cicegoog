from premeditation end study, the passione which stirred him ιο speek
with lira sud energy et the moment of excitament, could not be readily
rekindled into equal force in the quiet of his study when the matter
that had moved him had long been decided.

The next periodis marked by tha names, among many others, of
C. Carbo, G. Curio, and 'Pi end 0. Gracchus. coruncanius and
Ia Crusus were the first who in copiousness of expression could be
said to rival the glory of the Greeks. Accordingly these two speakers
are minutely depicted, and their distinctiva characteristica well brought
out. Then a comparisou is instituted between Crassus,ee the most
learned lawyer among the oratore, and Q. Scoevola, as the greatest
orator among the lawyers, in order to enable cicero ιο malie Brutus
panegyrise him by saying theta similar relation seemed to exist
between Cicero and the levvyer Ser. Sulpicius. Next to Crassus and
Antonius, but after a long intermicare placed L. Philippus and O.
Julius Strabo. A little later egeln then these came a number of good
speakers, of whom C. Cotta and P. Sulpicius were, said Cicero, both in
his opinion aud in that of the general publio, by far the hest. On thie,
Atticus esis why he is so careiul to edd that he and the public coin·

Thon, ss Ο. Curio was considered by some persons to range next in

made him popular, in spite of his many oratorical deficiencies, was the

'l'hus cicero is brought down to Hortensius, who, having been his
own cotemporary end rival, would fittingly close the list of those of
whom Cicero proposed to speak. Here, however, Brutus entreats
Cicero not to conclude without statingthe course of study by which
he had arrived at his own consummate eloqueuce. Cicero promises to
comply with this nequest, after he has detailsd the names of the
speakers who were coeval with Hortensius; but, before prooesding to
do so, makes Brutus give such an eulogium on the living orator M.
Marcellus, as to reflect still more praise on Cicero, and then lesda
Atticus with equal skill to dwell on the pure Latinity and felicitous
esse and rare erudition of Oaesar, in order therehy to heighten ιο the
utmost the strong encomium passed by Caesar upon Cicero, as having
deserved well of the Romen state for having been the chief pattern
