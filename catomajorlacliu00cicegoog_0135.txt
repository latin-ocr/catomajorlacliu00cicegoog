go to prove that the sonl may be immortal, than that it must. Hence
the cona-icrion, and the hopes springing from it, were strong enough
for the fair weather of life, not for its storms.

But here the facts of the N ew Testament History come in, and by
explaining the character and purposes of (iod, by exhibiting the life of
God iu the life of a man, “have abolishsd death and brought life and
immortality to light'' The death and resurrection of Christ have
vindicated death against our horror of it by distinctly showing that it
leads not to annihilation, hut to another life, which dces not fear
another death. “Iam the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth ἵ
in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live : and whosoever liveth ¹

and believeth in me shall never die:”-that is the charter of our l

immortality, the pledge (far surer than any unproveable assertion of
the soul's natural and indefectible immortality) that that which has
began shall never end, that that which has once been given shall
never be resumed, but be aided ever to press forward to a fuller share
of that Divina life which the revelation of the Son has shown to be in ¹
theFather. ' ¹

I⁸⁸ Dedication of the work to Atticus, and astatsment of its pur-
port and structure.

0 Tite, dra, is a quotation from the Annals of Ennius, who was born
at Rudiae, in Calabria, ab. 239. The lines were originally addressedto
Titus Quinctius Flamininus, who conquered Philip of Macedon at Cynos·
cephalae, ac. 197, and Nabis tho tyrant two years after; but they are
here meant for Cicero’s intimate friend Titus Pomponius Atticus, to
whom Cicero dedicatos the treatise. Flamininus was in diatress of
mind in consequence probably either of the omeua referred to in Livy
xxxii. 93 or the difficulty he experienced in bringing Philip to abattle.
See Livy. xxxii. 9-11. Atticus was in distreus in consequence of the
disordered state of tho republic. See introduction—odjetrois put for

Ennius himself. Ennius’s poverty is spoken of below, c. v.-plenn’ for
